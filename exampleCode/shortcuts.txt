I thought these shortcuts were neat

cursor over line + (ctrl + c) + (ctrl + v) = Copy a line to a new line

cursor over line + (ctrl + x) = Delete Line

alt + upArrow/downArrow = Moves line up or down

alt + mouseClick = to change line to different spot

highlight word + (ctrl + d) = highlights next instance of highlighted word

ctrl + p = search for a file
