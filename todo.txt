---TODO----
1. Change checkbox form to only accept one value at time (change to multiple choice form and populate) DONE
2. View Preset 
3. empty responses DONE
    -edit preset, if no preset is selected, prompt for a selection (exception handling)
        (see controller)
4. insert ga.html latency table into homepage.html // 4.28 seconds // Too Slow for users

---SUGGESTIONS----
1. Make sure add preset checks for empty names.. set default to "PresetX" DONE
-   where x is the number preset, ie. Preset1, Preset2, Preset3...
2. Change edit preset(?)- works well. Might be more intiutive to pass old preset back 
- into form and edit old preset instead of creating new preset altogether.. 
3. Add an "About" page (use coding/binary font?) 
4. Code Named S.H.E.R.L.O.C.K.-- transformation JS
5. Intermediaries:
    - task completed successfully messages
6. access username and display it on screen DONE
7. Login page- default to login page on start, also match theme.
