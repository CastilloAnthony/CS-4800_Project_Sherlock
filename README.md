# CS-4800_Server-Status-Checker
This program is designed for California State University Stanislaus' CS-4800 2023 Fall class. It is meant to be able to ping servers to check to see if they are up (responsive) or if they are down (unresponsive). The program will ping based on a user given or predetermined poll rate. The status of the server is then saved to a file alongside a timestamp which will be used later to display a histogram of each indvidual server's status.
